Hair Tracker AI

Hair Tracker AI is an advanced AI-powered application that leverages machine learning models to provide tailored solutions for various hair-related concerns. The app uses four distinct models to address common issues such as hair loss prediction, product recommendations, hair type classification, and overall hair health monitoring. The datasets used for these models are sourced from Kaggle, ensuring robust training and reliable predictions.

Key Features:
Hair Loss Prediction: Accurately predicts the likelihood of hair loss based on multiple factors such as age, genetics, lifestyle, and more.
Hair Care Product Recommendation: Recommends the best hair care products suited for different hair types and conditions, offering personalized hair care routines.
Hair Type Classification: Identifies and classifies hair into distinct types (straight, wavy, curly) based on visual and structural features.
Hair Health Monitoring: Continuously monitors hair health, detecting signs of damage, thinning, or other health issues for proactive care.

The application is powered by four comprehensive datasets sourced from Kaggle:
